<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The representation of a point in space
Five characteristics:
• The x-coordinate
• The y-coordinate
• The depth z
• A new and disturbing w-coordinate
• A color represented as an instance of the class Color
    • The color of the vertex will always be an instance of the class Color.

• The Vertex class provides read/write functions for all five attributes.
• '__toString' function allows use of Vertex as string.

• The class constructor expects an array. Expected keys are the following:
    'X':        the x-coordinate of the vertex            (mandatory)
    'Y':        the y-coordinate of the vertex            (mandatory)
    'Z':        the z-coordinate of the vertex            (mandatory)
    'W':        default is 1.0                            (optional)
    'Color':    default is a fresh instance of white    (optional)

• Static boolean 'verbose' controls the displays associated with
    the use of the class (default is FALSE).
• Color of the vertex is added to the string if 'verbose' is TRUE.
• If 'verbose' is true, then the builder and destructor of the class will produce an output.
• 'doc' function returns the content of the documentation.
