# get_next_line_42_C

To make it work:
- make libft and obtain their library
- After you may compile get_next_line.c 
- A main, may be done to test, by putting get_next_line function within a loop to read the lines of a file one by one
- Get_next_line returns a int: -1 --> case of error with the file descriptor or read;
0 --> when the file is over from being read (the EOF was reached)
1 --> when a line is read
