<- KamikazeRock ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The KamikazeRock is a faction that is only capable of moving and has no attack,
other than blowing themselves up and taking others down with them.

When you construct it, you need to provide a position(x, y), a width, a height,
the name of this specific instance and the player who owns it.
