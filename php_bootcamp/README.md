# PHP_Piscine_42
This is a giant folder containing all of the work that I did during the PHP pool at 42. Each dXX folder represents a day, and the rushes were conducted during each weekend. (There were no 'day' projects on Saturday or Sunday.) Each day opens at 9 am the day of and finishes at 11:42 the following day. While technically each day was open for 38 hours and 42 minutes, a new day came out every 24 hours. The rushes opened on Friday at 8 pm and closed on Sunday at 11:42 pm.  

I had never done any work in web or PHP or object-oriented design before the pool, so everything was completely new. From d06 and onwards, object oriented design (or in French, "POO") starts.
