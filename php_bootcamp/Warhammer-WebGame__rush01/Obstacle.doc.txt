<- Obstacle ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Obstacle object is any object operating in the field; it has a position_x, 
a position_y, a width and a height protected properties.

When you construct it, you need to provide a position(x, y), a width
and a height.

The isOccupying function tells you wether the ship occupies position located at
x and y.

The public methods getPositionX, getPositionY, getHeight, getWidth give you the
position (x, y) and the measures (height, width).
