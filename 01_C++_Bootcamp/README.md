# C++ Bootcamp (C++ Piscine at Ecole 42)

**14 days Bootcamp in C++ at Ecole 42**

This is a giant folder containing all of the work that I did during the C++ Piscine at 42. Each dXX folder represents a day, and the rushes were conducted during each weekend. (There were no 'day' projects on Saturday or Sunday.) Each day opens at 9 am the day of and finishes at 11:42 the following day. While technically each day was open for 38 hours and 42 minutes, a new day came out every 24 hours. The rushes opened on Friday at 8 pm and closed on Sunday at 11:42 pm.

Before this, I had done ComputorV1 in C++. However most concepts and challenges
in the bootcamp were new to me.
