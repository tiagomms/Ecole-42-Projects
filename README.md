# ComputorV1_Cplusplus
First project ever in object-oriented programming and C++.
ComputorV1 is a calculator of polynomials in the second or less degree. For the calculations, it is used the quadratic formula.
Polynomials of higher degree are not calculated.
This is all done in the terminal, after making the Makefile.

Try out (must always use capital X):
./computor "X^2 -2*X + 1 = 0"
./computor "X -2*X^1 + 1 = 25*X^0"
./computor "3*X^2 -2*X^1 + 1 = 25*X^0"
./computor "X^2 -2*X^3 + 1 = 0"
./computor "X^2 -2*X^3 + 1 = -2*X^3"
./computor "25 = 25"
./computor "23 = 21"
(...)

When possible it returns a fraction (not necessarily irreductible).
