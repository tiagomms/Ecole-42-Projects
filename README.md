# Unity_C-Piscine_42
This is a giant folder containing all of the work that I did during the Unity pool at 42. Each dXX folder represents a day, and the rushes were conducted during each weekend. (There were no 'day' projects on Saturday or Sunday.) Each day opens at 9 am the day of and finishes at 11:42 the following day. While technically each day was open for 38 hours and 42 minutes, a new day came out every 24 hours. The rushes opened on Friday at 8 pm and closed on Sunday at 11:42 pm.

I had never done any work in Unity and C# (Javacript or Boo were not allowed).
The first week all work was on Unity2D, and the second Unity3D.
Unity version 5 used.

SumUp of your day-to-day focus.

WEEK 1 - UNITY2D.
day00 - intro to unity2D.
day01 - 2D physics, triggers, layers, scenes, getcomponent, load scenes.
day02 - audio & animations.
day03 - build, advanced inputs, GUI & UI setup.
day04 - PlayerPref and CoRoutines.
rush00 - Hotline Miami makeover.

WEEK 2 - UNITY3D.
d05 - Intro to Unity3D (basics) and camera movement.
d06 - audio, shaders and particles.
d07 - navmesh, gui3D, raycast and spherecast.
d08 - animation.
d09 - make a FPS to kill zombie hordes.
rush01 - Hack & Slash game.


This was a very intensive piscine, with a lot of work and details to be fulfilled.
So there is an obvious lack of comments in all my work, which is somehow normal considering the amount of pressure and learning we need to make in two weeks. 

It isalso a Very big repository. So, this will take some time to load (expect 5GB of space approximately).
You need to have Unity 5 and above installed in your computer (we used Personal Edition).

Any question, let me know.
