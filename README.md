# ComputorV1_Cplusplus
With a brief intro in PhP to OOP, this is my first project ever in object-oriented design and C++.
I have never coded in C++ before.

Goal of the project: solve until the 2nd polynomial degree equations, and find their zeros.
Input string like this: - 1.23... * X^4... + ... = ...

In Regex: (+|-) (0-9)*(\\.((0-9)*))? \\* X \\^(0-9)*
