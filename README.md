# Ecole-42-Projects

**École 42 Projects (Nov 2014 - Dec 2015) divided by programming language into branches**

***Please change branch to see projects***

École 42 is a tuition and teacher-free computer science school centred around the ideas of peer learning, project-based work and self-motivation. Each student would select the projects he/she was interested in doing and code with the help of peers and the Internet. When the project was concluded, we would submit the project to correction and other peers would evaluate and test our code. If there were bugs or the code did not follow the pre-established norms, we would fail the projects. If we succeeded, points were credited to our account, which would help us unlock new projects - much like a videogame character.

In addition to the projects, there were the 42 Piscines (42 Pools), and the 42 Rushes. The Piscines were 2 to 3 week-long non-stop programming bootcamps to learn new programming frameworks. If we succeeded, new projects on that framework would be unlocked from that moment on. The Rushes were 48-hour collaborative projects in which we had to learn, use the requested frameworks and finish the project to succeed.

In the branches - I have projects in the following languages:
- **C**
- **Web programming using PHP/MySQL/HTML/CSS/Javascript**
- **Assembly**
- **C++**
- **Unity in C#**
